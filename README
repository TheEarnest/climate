See the Github wiki for more: http://github.com/tokumine/climate/wikis

ToDo
=====

# make useful outside of the toy example...
# allow any type of climate surface variable
# do decoding/recalculation of lat/long if not in lon180 format
# auto downloading and installation from IPCC?
# Allow nicer access to the contents of the rubyNetCDF object - enough with the .gets!
